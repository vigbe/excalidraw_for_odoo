Excalidraw for Odoo
===================

Embeds the Excalidraw whiteboard (https://excalidraw.com) as a chatter tool,
fully self-hosted (no CDN required).

Features
--------
* Pencil button in every record chatter opens a drawing picker and a
  fullscreen editor; drawings are stored on the host record.
* Each drawing persists as an editable .excalidraw scene JSON plus a PNG
  render (an ir.attachment pair on the host record).
* Autosave: 45 s inactivity debounce, 60 s max-latency guard, flush on
  dialog close; concurrent saves are last-write-wins.
* Built-in Excalidraw export dialog (PNG / SVG) and .excalidraw file import.
* Permission model: Users (create/edit) and Managers groups gate the tool.
* Vendored library: @excalidraw/excalidraw 0.18.1 (MIT) bundled with esbuild,
  fonts served locally via window.EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH.

Breaking change (19.0.2.0.0)
---------------------------
The standalone "Excalidraw" application and its drawing model were removed.
Updating permanently destroys previously stored standalone drawings (they
are not migrated). Security groups are kept (they gate the new chatter
tool). Note: Odoo keeps the old table on update — see the README deploy
runbook to drop it explicitly and reclaim the space.
